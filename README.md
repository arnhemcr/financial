# Arnhemcr/financial

This Go module translates financial transactions 
from arbitrary [comma-separated values (CSV)] to a standard format.
It allows transactions from account statements in a variety of CSV formats
to be merged for analysis and reporting.

## Program csv2trn

CSV2trn [filters] transactions from CSV records, in an account statement, to a standard format.
The format of the input CSV records is configured by [XML].
The format of the output transactions can be
either [Ledger] journal entries or this module's CSV records.

For more information and examples, see `go doc` in the csv2trn directory.

## Package transaction

This package represents a financial transaction as an instance of type Transaction.
A transaction is the transfer of an amount of currency from one account to another on a date.
It is described by a memo and code,
also known as the transaction's description and type respectively.
A transaction belongs to an account known as this account.

This package offers:

  - parsing a transaction from a CSV record; 
    an instance of type CSVRecordFormat configures the parser for the record format
  - stringing a transaction to either a Ledger journal entry or this module's CSV record

For more information, see `go doc -all` in the transaction directory.
